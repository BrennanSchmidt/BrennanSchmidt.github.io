	// demonstrate each of the shortcut assignment operators
	// += is an assignment operator, that, when followed by an expression with a numerical value, will add the value of that expression to the value of the variable to the left of the operator, and assign the result to that variable.
	// -= It's a shortcut for operation assignment. It first processes the right side of the statement before applying the operator to the original variable on the left end of the statement.
	// etc.
	
	
	// demonstrate the auto decrement and auto increment operators
	// ++ doubles the variable that it is assigned to
	// -- subtracts itsself from the variable it is given to
	// etc.
